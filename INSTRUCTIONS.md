# Cosmic Encounter Simulator 2 - Development Instructions

## Project Goals

Build a comprehensive simulator for the board game Cosmic Encounter with the following objectives:

1. **Simulate games under various start conditions**
   - Variable number of players (3-8)
   - Configurable alien powers per game
   - Different game variants and rules

2. **Model the game as closely as possible**
   - Full encounter flow (Regroup, Destiny, Launch, Alliance, Planning, Reveal, Resolution)
   - All card types (Attack, Negotiate, Morph, Reinforcement, Artifact, Flare)
   - Destiny deck mechanics
   - Rewards deck mechanics
   - Ship management (colonies, warp, hyperspace gate)
   - Win conditions (5 foreign colonies, alternate win conditions)

3. **Implement comprehensive alien powers**
   - Target: 50+ alien powers from base game and expansions
   - Properly handle power timing and interactions
   - Support for power activation/deactivation

4. **Intelligent AI decision-making**
   - Strategic card selection
   - Alliance invitation and acceptance logic
   - Power usage optimization
   - Multiple AI strategy profiles

5. **Robust statistics and analysis**
   - Win rates by alien power
   - Win rates by player count
   - Power interaction matrices
   - Game length statistics
   - Export capabilities (CSV, JSON)

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- Modern Python package structure with clear separation of concerns
- Type hints throughout for better code quality
- Dataclasses for game state representation
- Event-driven system for power triggers

### Key Rules Researched
From official FFG rules and BoardGameGeek:

**Eight Encounter Phases:**
1. Start Turn - Check for encounter cards, draw if needed
2. Regroup - Retrieve one ship from warp to any colony
3. Destiny - Draw destiny card to determine defender
4. Launch - Select planet and commit 1-4 ships
5. Alliance - Both sides invite, players accept in clockwise order
6. Planning - Secretly select encounter cards
7. Reveal - Reveal cards and trigger powers
8. Resolution - Determine winner, move ships, award rewards

**Alliance Rewards (Defense Only):**
- For each ship committed: draw 1 card OR retrieve 1 ship from warp

**Compensation:**
- When losing with Negotiate vs Attack: draw cards equal to ships lost to warp

**Failed Deal Penalty:**
- Both Negotiate cards: 1 minute to deal, or both lose 3 ships to warp

**Second Encounter:**
- Allowed if: (1) won or dealt first encounter, AND (2) have encounter cards

### Session Progress Log

**Session Start (2025-12-30):**
- Began with 68 alien powers
- Created update_stats.py and ELO rating system
- Ran initial simulations

**Mid-Session:**
- Added reinforcement card support to combat
- Implemented defensive ally reward choices (cards OR ships)
- Added 61 new alien powers (now at 129 total)
- Ran 22,000+ simulated games

**Final Session Stats (2025-12-30):**
- 155 alien powers implemented (started with 68)
- 50,000+ games simulated across 3-6 players
- ELO ratings stable with meaningful tier differentiation
- Reinforcement cards now work in combat
- Defensive ally rewards now offer choice (cards OR ships)
- Comprehensive statistics with per-player-count breakdowns

**Continued Development (2025-12-30 - Session 2):**
- **200 alien powers now implemented!**
- Added exotic_powers.py, legendary_powers.py, cosmic_powers.py
- Added classic_powers.py with 10 additional powers
- Fixed duplicate alien registrations
- Cleared Python cache issues
- Running ~400 games/second simulation speed

**Top Powers by ELO (as of 50k games):**
1. Machine (56.7% win rate) - S tier, extra encounters are extremely powerful
2. Parasite (45.9% win rate) - A tier, can join any encounter uninvited
3. Warpish (32.5% win rate) - B tier, strong defensive positioning
4. Tripler (29.4% win rate) - B tier, card manipulation
5. Symbiote (30.7% win rate) - B tier, double starting ships

**Observations:**
- Powers that give extra encounters or attacks are strongest (Machine)
- Powers that allow uninvited alliance participation are very strong (Parasite)
- Powers that scale with ships in warp or colonies are situationally strong
- Win rates decrease as player count increases (expected behavior)
- Average win rate is ~22% (1/4.5 players on average)
