Personality-based AI strategies for Cosmic Encounter.

- AggressiveAI: Commits maximum ships, plays highest cards, rarely negotiates
- CautiousAI: Conserves resources, negotiates more, avoids risky encounters
- OpportunisticAI: Allies frequently, targets weak players
- SocialAI: Focuses on alliances and deals over combat
