# Cosmic Encounter Simulator

<!-- NOTE: Only update the stats table below or feature implementation status. Do not modify other sections unless specifically requested. -->

A simulation of the board game Cosmic Encounter for analyzing alien power balance. Features **5700+ alien powers**, multiple AI strategies (including AggressiveAI, CautiousAI, OpportunisticAI, SocialAI, AdaptiveAI, LearningAI), and comprehensive statistics tracking across 2-6 player games.

## Basic Game Rules / Flow of the Simulator


### Encounter Phases

Each encounter follows these sequential phases:

1. **START_TURN** - Checks if active player has encounter cards (minimum 1 required)
2. **REGROUP** - Offense retrieves 1 ship from warp to any home colony
3. **DESTINY** - Determine defender (draw destiny deck, or offense chooses in 2-player mode)
4. **LAUNCH** - Offense aims hyperspace gate at defender's planet, commits 1-4 ships
5. **ALLIANCE** - Both sides invite allies; allies commit ships to either side
6. **PLANNING** - Both sides secretly select encounter cards (and optional kicker cards)
7. **REVEAL** - Cards revealed; flare cards can be played
8. **RESOLUTION** - Winner determined, ships go to warp or establish colonies


### Combat Resolution

```
OFFENSE TOTAL = Card Value + Ship Count + Kickers + Power Mods + Reinforcements + Tech Bonus
DEFENSE TOTAL = Card Value + Ship Count + Kickers + Power Mods + Reinforcements + Tech Bonus + Station Bonus
```

- **Attack vs Attack**: Higher total wins (or lower if Loser/Antimatter power active)
- **Both Negotiate**: Deal phase triggered; failed deals send 3 ships each to warp
- **Negotiate vs Attack**: Attacker wins; negotiator receives compensation (1 card per ship committed)


### Win Conditions

- **Standard**: Establish 5 foreign colonies (4 in 2-player mode)
- **Alternate Wins**: Some alien powers have special victory conditions
- **Shared Victories**: Multiple players can win simultaneously


### Turn Progression

- One encounter per turn normally
- Second encounter allowed if offense won/dealt AND has encounter cards remaining
- Machine power allows multiple encounters regardless of outcome

## Notable Implementation Decisions


### Faithful to Official Rules

- **Ship counts**: 1-4 ships per encounter (base rules)
- **Compensation**: Exactly 1 card per ship when negotiate loses
- **Failed deals**: 3 ship penalty per player (or all if fewer)
- **Rewards**: Defensive allies choose cards OR ships (1 per committed)
- **Second encounters**: Only if won/dealt AND have encounter cards
- **Colony definition**: Ships on opponent's planet = foreign colony


### Simplified from Official Rules

| Area | Simplification | Reason |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Destiny redraw | No timer for self-destiny | Simulation simplicity |
| Deal negotiation | Basic deal types only | AI complexity reduction |
| Ally invitations | Single round, no back-and-forth | Simulation speed |
| Flare timing | Single-phase activation | Reduced state complexity |
| Card counting | AI doesn't track played cards | Performance optimization |


### Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Event-driven power hooks | Allows clean phase-specific activation without monolithic switch statements |
| GamePhase enum state machine | Clear phase progression, easy debugging |
| Pluggable AI strategies | Enables strategy comparison and personality experiments |
| One file per alien power | Maintainability with 4500+ powers |
| Full type hints | Catches errors early, improves IDE support |


### Not Implemented

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Lux Currency (Odyssey) | Framework only | Economy system scaffolded but not active |
| Rift Cards (Odyssey) | Framework only | Trap system scaffolded but not active |
| Cross-power synergy tracking | Limited | Some power interactions may not fully compound |
| Tournament timing rules | Not implemented | Simulation doesn't enforce time limits |
